# Description:
# This component lays out all the directories and users and permissions
# needed to compile the rest of the project.

# - creates empty sysroot
# - creates crosstools dir
# - creates source build dir
# - creates build group
# - creates build user
# - sets ownership of build dir to build user

# clean the environment just in case
